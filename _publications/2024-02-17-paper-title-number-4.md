Our paper introduces JST, a two-stage approach to improve data valuation. By using low-quality data as a validation set in a second valuation round, JST effectively highlights high-quality data. Tested on standard datasets with optimal transport-based methods, JST outperforms traditional methods, especially in low-noise conditions. This framework is also applicable to various data valuation techniques, including influence functions, Shapley values, and reinforcement learning.'
