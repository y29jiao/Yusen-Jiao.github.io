Iâ€˜m Yusen Jiao, a recent graduate from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Master's degree in Systems Design Engineering, specializing in AI and Machine Learning. I also completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. 

Currently, I am collaborating with Yifei Zhang and Professor [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/), from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Together, we have completed a paper: [Just Select Twice: Leveraging Low Quality Data to Improve Data Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jmHCvlqj2i) on Data-Centric Machine Learning, which we submitted to the NeurIPS Benchmark Track. Prior to this, I was a Research Assistant at the University of California, Berkeley.

My primary research interest lies in leveraging machine learning and deep learning to address real-world problems. This interest naturally extends to computer vision and image processing, which are broad fields. Specifically, I am passionate about AI for healthcare, as this area perfectly represents the application of image processing to solve tangible issues.
