Iâ€˜m Yusen Jiao, a recent graduate from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Master's degree in Systems Design Engineering, specializing in AI and Machine Learning. I also completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. 

Currently, I am fortunate to serve as a Research Assistant at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), collaborating with Yifei Zhang, advised by Professor [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). Together, we have completed a paper: [Just Select Twice: Leveraging Low Quality Data to Improve Data Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jmHCvlqj2i) on Data-Centric Machine Learning, which we submitted to the NeurIPS Benchmark Track. Prior to this, I was a Research Assistant at the University of California, Berkeley.

My primary research interest lies in leveraging machine learning and deep learning to address real-world problems. This interest naturally extends to computer vision and image processing, which are broad fields. Specifically, I am passionate about AI in healthcare, as this area perfectly represents the application of image processing to solve tangible issues.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
